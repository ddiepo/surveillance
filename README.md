# surveillance
Surveillance is a lightweight video surveillance system using ffmpeg and [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ "Motion")   intended for use on Raspberry Pi with network attached dual-stream cameras, but usable on any linux system with any video source for which ffmpeg & motion support.


Purpose:

1. I was not able to find an existing software package that met my needs of providing full high-def video stream recordings and motion detection to flag video segments that could run with limited CPU available on a raspberry pi.

2. I wanted to increase my Python knowledge, which has previously been limited to very small projects, the largest of which was a database translation and mostly were very small, no more than a single function. This project seemed large enough to be interesting and require learning some of the language capabilities I hadn't previously been exposed to.

With #2 in mind, along with my previous software knowledge existing primarily of c++, java, ada and c, I welcome feedback from more experienced python developers on more pythonic -- I'd like to learn more.
